Clustering Customers 

This is my third machine learning project for clustering international e-commence customers based on their past purchase patterns and item preferences. The entire project is splited into four steps: data wrangling, dimensionality reduction, and clustering analysis. I trained three K-Means models to different datasets with various features to explore the performance of clusters. 

The project is part of the professional training program in Elite Data Science Academy.
